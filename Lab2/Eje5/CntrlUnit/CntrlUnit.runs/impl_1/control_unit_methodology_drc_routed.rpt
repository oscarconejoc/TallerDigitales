Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell addr_rd_OBUF[0]_inst_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[0]/CLR, FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[1]/CLR, FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[2]/CLR, data_phase_reg/CLR, op_counter_reg[0]/CLR, op_counter_reg[1]/CLR, op_counter_reg[2]/CLR, op_counter_reg[3]/CLR, reg_addr_reg[0]/CLR, reg_addr_reg[1]/CLR, reg_addr_reg[2]/CLR, reg_addr_reg[3]/CLR, reg_addr_reg[4]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
